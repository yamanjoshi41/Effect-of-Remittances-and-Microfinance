# Effect-of-Remittances-and-Microfinance
An Assessment of the Effects of Microfinance and Remittances on Poverty in Developing Countries

The United Nations sustainable development goal number 1 is to “End poverty in all its forms
everywhere” (United Nations, 2024). About 575 million people are expected to face
extreme poverty by 2030 (United Nations, 2024). Reducing poverty has been a focus of
international organizations and developing country governments. The current research analyzes the effects of microfinance and remittances on reducing poverty. It uses a sample
of 97 developing countries from 1990-2020. It conducts robust OLS estimations. It finds
that microfinance reduces poverty when remittances are not added to the OLS regression model.
However, when remittances are included in the model, microfinance does not have a significant
reducing effect on poverty even though remittances do.
